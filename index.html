							<h1> Hello!</h1>
						</header>
						<h2>I am currently a student at Brigham Young University, pursuing MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering.</h2><h3> My interest lies in the field of bio-inspired multi-agent systems. I am to model phenomenon in nature to help solve problems like disease spread, power cuts, and power theft. I would also like to use models derived from natural systems to make robust and efficient robots capable of performing various tasks ranging from exploration to helping us in vigilance and environment protection, to enforcing basic cleanliness on public streets for fighting water, soil and air pollution. I currently work with Dr. Cammy Peterson at the MAGICC Lab, for coordinated encirclement of targets in environments with no GPS and connectivity. This research aims to target the problem of illegal poaching and fishing by using multiple vehicles to search and track larger areas.</h3>
